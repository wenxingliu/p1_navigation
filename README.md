### Introduction

This repo provides a possible solution to training agent to navigate and collect bananas in a large, squre world. 

![Trained Agent][image1]


##### Reward Policy
A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

##### State Space
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  

##### Action Space
Given state information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the trained agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Instructions

Code in this repo contains five pieces, as described below:
 
 * *q_network.py* is where we define the structure of Q-Networks.
 
 * *agent.py* is where we define the agent class, including how the agent uses Q-Networks to represent its state-action values, and how the agent chooses actions based on current state, and also how the agent learn from past experiences and updates its state-action values.
 
 * *train_dqn.py* is where we defines how to train or evaluate the agent in the given environment. The function in this script can also be used in evaluating the trained agent when argument _train_ is set to _False_.
 
 * *Navigation.ipynb* calls all three scripts above and trains the agent. The notebook also shows the outputs and reward plots from the trained agent. 
 
 * Trained Q-Network weights is saved as *checkpoint.pth*
